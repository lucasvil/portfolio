            <h3>Laboratory Management System</h3>

            <p>This was a project I started back in november 2017 when I first learned python. I was the sole
                creator/developer for the first year of the project before I was able to hire help.
                <br>
                <br>
                The system stored fuel sample data for the entire lab and provided an interface for lab chemists and
                admins to view, add and send data to clients.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lab results would be generated by the system in PDF form and automatically sent to the client along with
                an interface for customers to be able to login and view.
                <br>
                <br>
                Customers had the ability to view all their data with a dynamic search form, trend data, add notes to
                reports and even map their samples' physical location.
                <br>
                <br>
                I worked on this system for 2 years before selling this to FOI Laboratories.
